**Signup and Login Forms with Input Validation**

This project features a signup form and a login form developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal is to create interactive forms that validate user inputs before allowing access to a designated access page.

Key Features:

**Signup Form:

Collects user details such as name, email, and password.
Implements client-side validation to ensure all required fields are filled out correctly.
Provides real-time feedback to users through error messages for invalid inputs.
Upon successful validation, stores user information securely (e.g., in local storage or a backend database).

**Login Form:

Prompts users to enter their login credentials (e.g., email and password).
Validates user inputs to authenticate against predefined criteria.
Displays error messages for incorrect login details.
Redirects authenticated users to an access page upon successful login.

**Technologies Used:

HTML: Defines the structure of the signup and login forms.
CSS: Styles the forms for a visually appealing user interface.
JavaScript: Implements client-side validation logic for form inputs and form submission behavior.
